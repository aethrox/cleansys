# Project Context

## Project Name
Digital Declutter Helper

## Core Purpose
A minimalist CLI tool that helps users systematically identify and remove digital clutter from their file system through criteria-based scanning and interactive review.

## Philosophy
- **Minimalism**: Every feature must justify its existence
- **Safety**: No destructive action without explicit user approval
- **Clarity**: Simple, predictable behavior over complex features
- **Focus**: Stay within scope, reject feature creep

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **CLI Framework**: Click or Typer (choose one)
- **Dependencies**: Standard library preferred
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

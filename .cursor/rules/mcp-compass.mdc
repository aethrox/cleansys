# MCP Compass Integration

## What is mcp-compass?
mcp-compass is a discovery and recommendation service that helps explore Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through natural language queries, acting as a smart guide to find and understand available MCP services for specific tasks.

## Purpose in This Project
Use mcp-compass to discover and evaluate relevant MCP servers that could enhance cleansys functionality while maintaining our minimalist philosophy.

## When to Use mcp-compass

### Discovery Phase
- **Before adding external integrations**: Search for existing MCP servers that provide needed functionality
- **Evaluating alternatives**: Compare different MCP services for the same capability
- **Understanding ecosystem**: Explore what's available without manual research

### Evaluation Queries
```
"Find MCP servers for file system operations"
"Search for servers that handle archive creation"
"Find services for safe file deletion"
```

### Integration Consideration
When mcp-compass suggests a server:
1. **Check scope-control.mdc**: Does it fit our minimalist goals?
2. **Verify simplicity**: Would it add complexity?
3. **Assess dependencies**: Does it require external services?
4. **Review safety**: Does it maintain our safety-first approach?

## Usage Guidelines

### DO Use For:
- Discovering file system MCP servers
- Finding backup/archive solutions
- Researching safe deletion tools
- Exploring metadata extraction services

### DO NOT Use For:
- Adding features outside project scope
- Bypassing architectural decisions
- Introducing complex dependencies
- Justifying feature creep

## Decision Framework

When mcp-compass recommends a server, ask:
1. Does it serve our core purpose (identify/remove clutter)?
2. Can we implement it with standard library instead?
3. Would it require network access? ❌ Reject
4. Does it add persistent state? ❌ Reject
5. Would it make the tool less predictable? ❌ Reject

## Integration Rules

### Before Adding Any MCP Server:
- **Document justification**: Why standard library isn't sufficient
- **Verify scope fit**: Reference scope-control.mdc
- **Test in isolation**: Ensure it works as expected
- **Maintain safety**: All safety-requirements.mdc rules still apply
- **Keep it optional**: Core features must work without it

## Examples of Acceptable Use

```
User: "Are there MCP servers for better archive compression?"
Response: Search mcp-compass, then evaluate if:
- It's worth the dependency
- Compression is a core need
- Standard library zipfile is insufficient
```

## Examples of Rejected Use

```
User: "Let's add cloud backup via MCP"
Response: ❌ Outside scope - cleansys is local-only tool
Even if mcp-compass finds perfect server, reject per scope-control.mdc
```

## Best Practices
- Use mcp-compass for research, not automatic adoption
- Every suggestion must pass through our decision framework
- Prefer standard library over external MCP servers
- Document why we chose or rejected suggestions
- Keep project dependencies minimal

# Context7 Integration

## What is Context7?
Context7 is an MCP server that fetches up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples directly from official sources. It eliminates outdated code suggestions, hallucinated APIs, and generic examples by providing real-time, accurate documentation.

## Purpose in This Project
Ensure all generated code uses current, accurate Python standard library APIs and best practices for Python 3.8+.

## How It Works
Include "use context7" in prompts when current documentation is needed. The server automatically fetches relevant docs and integrates them into responses.

## When to Use Context7

### Always Use For:
- **Python standard library questions**: Ensure current API usage
- **CLI framework specifics**: Get accurate Click/Typer examples
- **File system operations**: Verify pathlib, os, shutil methods
- **Archive creation**: Check zipfile current capabilities
- **Testing frameworks**: Get pytest latest features

### Example Usage:
```
Implement the scanner.py module using pathlib. use context7

Create CLI commands with Click for scanning directories. use context7

Show how to create zip archives with proper error handling. use context7

Write pytest fixtures for temporary file testing. use context7
```

## Best Practices

### DO:
- Include "use context7" when implementing new modules
- Reference it for standard library API verification
- Use it to check current best practices
- Verify framework-specific patterns

### DON'T:
- Use it for general programming questions
- Rely on it for architectural decisions (use our .mdc files)
- Let it override our documented safety requirements
- Add external libraries it suggests without scope evaluation

## Integration with Our Rules

### Priority Order:
1. **Safety requirements** (safety-requirements.mdc) → Always first
2. **Project scope** (scope-control.mdc) → Filter suggestions
3. **Context7 docs** → Implementation details
4. **Code standards** (code-standards.mdc) → Final formatting

### Example Flow:
```
Need to implement file deletion →
1. Check safety-requirements.mdc (must have confirmation)
2. Ask Context7 for current os.remove/pathlib.unlink usage
3. Implement with our safety wrappers
4. Follow code-standards.mdc formatting
```

## Handling Context7 Suggestions

### Accept When:
- Standard library API updates we weren't aware of
- Better error handling patterns
- More efficient pathlib methods
- Current pytest best practices

### Reject When:
- Suggests external dependencies (we prefer standard library)
- Recommends complex abstractions (we value simplicity)
- Proposes features outside our scope
- Bypasses our safety requirements

## Common Use Cases

### Module Implementation
```
I need to implement scanner.py that walks directories and 
collects file metadata. Show current best practices using 
pathlib and os.stat. use context7
```

### Error Handling
```
What's the current recommended way to handle PermissionError 
when accessing files in Python 3.8+? use context7
```

### Testing
```
Show how to create temporary directories with pytest fixtures 
for testing file operations. use context7
```

### CLI Framework
```
How do I create a Click command that accepts a Path argument 
and validates it exists? use context7
```

## Limitations

### Context7 Provides:
- ✅ Current API documentation
- ✅ Version-specific examples
- ✅ Official library usage patterns

### Context7 Does NOT Provide:
- ❌ Project-specific architectural guidance (use our .mdc files)
- ❌ Safety requirement enforcement (we handle this)
- ❌ Scope decisions (refer to scope-control.mdc)
- ❌ Code review for our specific patterns

## Quality Control

Before accepting Context7 suggestions:
1. Does it use standard library? ✅
2. Is it simple enough? (code-standards.mdc)
3. Does it fit our architecture? (module-guidelines.mdc)
4. Is it safe? (safety-requirements.mdc)
5. Is it in scope? (scope-control.mdc)

All five must be YES.

## Notes
- Context7 keeps us current with Python ecosystem
- It prevents using deprecated APIs
- It helps avoid outdated patterns from AI training data
- But our project rules always take precedence over any suggestion
